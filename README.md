# Transfer Learning Emulation
Computationally efficient way to build Gaussian Process emulators by transferring knowledge from the already existing emulators, for similar simulations when building new emulators for new simulation models. 

A simple example and a video presentation of how this work with the code can be found [here](https://github.com/danOSU/Isnet_2021_TL.git).
